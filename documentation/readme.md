# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

I suggest that you install [NestJS Framework](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview)

⚠️ Read [NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps) if you are new to this framework

If you do not have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed `npm install --global yarn`.


## First steps

### Installation

In order to install packages run `yarn install`.

### Environment

Create a `.env` file following the `.env.example` file,
this will allow you to have the application running.

Create a `.env.db` file following its `.env.db.example` file,
this will allow you to have the configs for the database.

### Run the API

In order to run the API with its database run `docker compose up`.
